description: Generate a poster image from a short idea — an LLM expands the idea into a detailed image prompt, then an image model renders it. Use when the user asks for a poster, illustration, or promo image from a one-line concept.

# Poster generator

Runs the bundled nanoodle workflow `workflows/poster.noodle-graph.json` against the NanoGPT
API: a text input (`Idea`) feeds an LLM that writes a vivid image prompt, which feeds an
image model that renders the poster (`Poster`). Requires Python >= 3.9 and the `nanoodle`
PyPI package (stdlib-only, `pip install nanoodle`).

## API key

The run needs a NanoGPT API key. Use whichever is available:

- `NANOGPT_API_KEY` already set in the environment — prefer this; no extra flags.
- A `.env` file containing `NANOGPT_API_KEY=...` — pass `--env-file <path>` only when the
  key is not already in the environment. (With this CLI, ambient environment variables win
  over `--env-file`.)

Never print the key.

## Run

From this skill's directory (or prefix paths if running from elsewhere):

```sh
python -m nanoodle run workflows/poster.noodle-graph.json \
  --input "Idea=<the user's poster idea, e.g. a cozy ramen shop on a rainy night>" \
  --out ./poster-out
```

(With the package installed, `nanoodle-py run …` is equivalent.) Add `--env-file .env` only
when the key is not already exported. For a machine-readable payload (paths, cost, balance),
add `--json`.

Optional style override (workflow also exposes this input):

```sh
--input "System prompt=<custom image-prompt writer instructions>"
```

Inspect the interface anytime with:

```sh
python -m nanoodle inspect workflows/poster.noodle-graph.json
```

## Outputs

- Media is saved under `--out` as `Poster.<ext>` where `<ext>` follows the image MIME
  (often `jpg` or `png`). **Use the path the CLI prints on the `Poster:` line** — do not
  hard-code `.png`.
- With `--json`, the path is in `outputs.Poster.file` (and cost/balance in the same object).
- The CLI also prints total cost (and remaining balance when the API reports it) to stderr.

## Cost

Each run costs about **$0.04** in NanoGPT credit (the image-generation step dominates; the
LLM prompt-writing step is a fraction of a cent).
